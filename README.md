# ArduinoProjects
### A repo for my Arduino Projects

## Flashlight
A toy car that was could never quite understand how to feel about light.
When it was in love, it would drive towards the light, forever seekings its approval. When it was in fear, it would run from the light - looking to hide in the darkness. When it was mad, it would speed towards the light, disobeying all the rules of the road. When it was in a state of curiousity, the car would tip-toe towards the light, accepting but questioning the light.
